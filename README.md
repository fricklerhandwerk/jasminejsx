# Jasmine JSX

A version of Jasmine 2.2.0 that works with Adobes' ExtendScript.  ExtendScript is a JavaScript variant that allows you to create and run scripts that extend Adobe's suite of create products.

To use Jasmine JSX:

 * Install Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit.
 * Download this project and open the file `specRunner.jsx`.
 * Run the script and watch the spec files in the JavaScript console run.
